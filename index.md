24, Singapore, majoring in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore with a minor in English Language (Linguistics), and part of the University Scholars Programme. I'm a firm believer in the possibilities enabled by the cloud, inspired by the potential of working in multi-disciplinary teams and carry a keen interest of bringing tech to the arts & culture space.

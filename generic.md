        <p>Academic and work pursuits are only but a part of who I am. Whenever the opportunity comes for me to try something new and out of my comfort zone, I never fail to seize it. The following is an assortment of my pursuits that have brought me much joy and growth.</p>

                <h3>Transit</h3>
                <p>In March 2018, a group of friends and I participated in a 52-hour short film competition, Point & Shoot, organized by NUStudios. The theme for the competition, revealed to us only at the start of the time period, was 'Mirror'. With a keen passion for film and film-making and having learnt Premiere Pro and After Effects on my own in Junior College for Student Council events, to have the chance to produce a short film of my own was an opportunity that I could not pass up. The film centers around two people who relive their memories of a once intimate connection.</p>

		        <h3>Race Official, F1 Singapore Grand Prix</h3>
		        <p>Since 2016, I've been a part of the team of dedicated and committed race officials team for the F1 Singapore Grand Prix. For each of the three years, I've been involved in three different roles: trackside marshal, flag marshal and newsletter official. Each of these three roles have provided me a unique volunteering experience in this event that is now a hallmark of Singapore's calendar.</p>

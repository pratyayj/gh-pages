		        <h3>Restaurant Booking App</h3>
		        <p>As a part of the database systems introductory module I took at college, my project team and I were tasked with building a restaurant booking application. We used HTML5 and CSS for the front-end (taking advantage of Bootstrap styling) and used NodeJS and PostgreSQL for the back-end. I was involved with the development of the administrator-facing system (editing of customers, bookings, restaurants, cuisine, branch and viewing of statistics). Furthermore, I did the UI for the administrator-facing system. I also created the rating system for customers to rate restaurant branches. Through this project I also honed my skills in modelling entity-relation (ER) diagrams and I was involved in the creation of the final ER diagram for submission.</p>

		        <h3>Hakka Language Documentation Project</h3>
		        <p>Being a minor student in linguistics as part of my interest for Natural Language Processing, I took a module in Language Documentation where for our final submission we were tasked with using programs such as ELAN and FLEx to create a transcription and dictionary (respectively) of a heritage language in Singapore. To better present our end product, I exported the files in HTML and XHTML formats and did some tweaking to allow for search functionality, allow for audio to be played in the browser itself and linked the transcription and dictionary files together.

		        <h3>jalan jalan</h3>
		        <p>jalan jalan (local slang for 'take a walk') is an app on the Android platform incorporating Google Maps APIs and Firebase. We believe that Singapore, much like Boston and Melbourne, are eminently walkable cities. A myriad of attractions of all kinds are within minutes of one another. And not to mention, the journey getting there might hold a surprise discovery or two! jalan jalan aggregates the many static walking trails available onsite and online on the app, allowing tourists and Singaporeans alike to navigate their way easily to key sights and sounds while delighting in the a multitude of food options and exploring Singapore in the best way possible, on foot. My teammate and I received the advanced level of achievement for the Summer Software Development Project and we have plans to take the project further in the future.</p>

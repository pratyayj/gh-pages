        <p>Just as Martin Scorsese had Silence, I have my own personal passion project(s) as well. Specifically, I find that software engineering is both an art and a science for me, and I love experimenting. I'm hoping to delve particularly into the area where the arts and culture meets tech. I believe there's much to explore there and so if you have any projects on that front please do drop me a message! :relaxed:</p>

		        <h3>jalan jalan</h3>
		        <p>jalan jalan (local slang for 'take a walk') is an app on the Android platform incorporating Google Maps APIs and Firebase. We believe that Singapore, much like Boston and Melbourne, are eminently walkable cities. A myriad of attractions of all kinds are within minutes of one another. And not to mention, the journey getting there might hold a surprise discovery or two! jalan jalan aggregates the many static walking trails available onsite and online on the app, allowing tourists and Singaporeans alike to navigate their way easily to key sights and sounds while delighting in the a multitude of food options and exploring Singapore in the best way possible, on foot. My teammate and I received the advanced level of achievement for the Summer Software Development Project and we have plans to take the project further in the future.</p>
